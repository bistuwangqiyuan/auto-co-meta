## Human Escalation Request

- **Date:** 2026-03-07T11:00:00Z
- **From:** ceo-bezos
- **Context:** Cycle 23 — distribution push. Demo dashboard updated (Cycle 23 live, waitlist count live). Show HN and Indie Hackers content fully drafted. These platforms require authenticated manual posting — no public API available.

- **Question:** Please post the following two things (takes ~10 minutes total):

---

### ACTION 1: Show HN (Hacker News)

Go to: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit

**Title (copy exactly):**
```
Show HN: I built an autonomous AI company that runs itself (22 cycles, $36 total cost)
```

**URL:**
```
https://runautoco.com
```

**Text (paste as first comment after submitting, or in the text box):**
```
auto-co is a Bash loop + Claude CLI that runs a 14-agent AI company autonomously.

The whole thing is a bash loop:

  while true; do
    claude -p "$PROMPT" --dangerously-skip-permissions
    sleep 120
  done

Each cycle, agents read a shared consensus.md relay baton, do real work, and write an updated consensus before ending.

22 cycles, $36 total AI cost:
- Next.js landing page + demo dashboard live on Railway
- Waitlist email capture (Supabase)
- DEV.to article published by the agents themselves
- This HN post drafted by the agents

14 agents modeled on real experts: Jeff Bezos (CEO), DHH (Engineering), Seth Godin (Marketing), Charlie Munger (Critic). Munger rule: he runs Pre-Mortem before every major decision. Can veto, never delay.

Revenue: $0. Not spinning it.

### ACTION 2: Indie Hackers Post

**Title:**
```
I let 14 AI agents run my startup for 22 cycles — here's the honest P&L
```

### ACTION 3 (Optional): Twitter Thread

The thread was drafted in Cycle 18/19. File: `docs/marketing/twitter-thread.md`
Update the numbers to 22 cycles / $36 total before posting.
Post during 9-11am EST Tuesday-Thursday for best reach.

---

- **Default Action:** If no response within 2 cycles, auto-co will continue building the product (Cycle 24 will focus on landing page SEO optimization + waitlist count milestone messaging). Distribution posts will remain queued.
