Most AI agent tutorials show you a single chatbot. This guide shows you how to build a **team of specialized AI agents** that collaborate, make decisions, and ship real software -- with working code you can run today.

**See it in action:** [Watch the 2-minute demo](https://youtu.be/1zJca_zFzys) of Auto-Co running a full autonomous cycle -- from reading state to forming a team to shipping code.

## Why a team, not a single agent?

A single AI agent with a massive prompt hits a ceiling fast. It tries to be everything -- planner, coder, reviewer, designer -- and excels at nothing. The prompt gets bloated, context fills up, and output quality degrades.

A team of specialized agents solves this. **Each agent has one job, one expert persona, and one set of tools.** A "CTO agent" thinks about architecture. A "QA agent" thinks about testing. A "Marketing agent" thinks about positioning. They collaborate through a shared state file, not a group chat.

This guide walks through the exact pattern we use in [Auto-Co](https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta), an open-source framework that has run 96+ autonomous cycles, shipping a full product for ~$181 total.

---

## Step 1: Define your agent roles

Start with the minimum viable team. You don't need 14 agents on day one. Start with 3-4 that cover the core loop:

| Role | Job | When to add |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Decision-maker | Reads state, decides what to do, picks the team | Day 1 |
| Builder | Writes code, implements features, deploys | Day 1 |
| Critic | Challenges decisions, finds flaws, prevents groupthink | Day 1 |
| Researcher | Gathers market data, validates assumptions | When needed |

The key principle: **personas encode thinking frameworks, not just job titles**. "CTO" is vague. "Werner Vogels -- everything fails all the time, design for failure" gives the agent a specific mental model to apply.

Each agent definition is a markdown file that describes the expert's thinking patterns, decision heuristics, and default behaviors:

```markdown
# Agent: critic-munger
## Expert Model: Charlie Munger
## Core Thinking Patterns:
- Inversion: "What would guarantee failure?"
- Checklist: systematic evaluation of every major decision
- Psychology of misjudgment: identify cognitive biases in the team
## Default Behavior:
- Must be consulted before any major decision
- Can veto but cannot delay -- if vetoing, must suggest alternative
- Always asks: "What's the downside? What am I missing?"
```

---

## Step 2: Build the coordination mechanism

This is where most multi-agent systems fail. Agents need to share state across sessions, but LLMs forget everything between invocations. You need a coordination mechanism.

We tested three approaches:

- **Vector database** -- Too noisy. Agents retrieved irrelevant context and made worse decisions than having no memory.
- **Structured JSON state** -- Too rigid. Every new field required schema changes.
- **Single markdown file** -- Just right. Structured enough to parse, flexible enough to evolve, small enough to fit in context.

We call this the **relay baton pattern**: one file that every cycle reads at the start and writes at the end.

```markdown
# consensus.md -- the relay baton

## Current Phase
Building -- Phase 2

## What We Did This Cycle
- Implemented user authentication
- Fixed deployment pipeline

## Key Decisions
- Chose Supabase over Firebase (simpler, cheaper)

## Metrics
- Revenue: $0
- Users: 12

## Next Action
Build the billing integration
```

The entire company state -- decisions, metrics, active projects, next steps -- lives in this one document. No database. No embeddings. Just markdown that fits in the context window.

---

## Step 3: Write the loop

The orchestration layer is simpler than you think. At its core, it's a loop that:

1. Reads the consensus file
2. Injects it into the prompt
3. Invokes the AI with the full context
4. The AI decides what to do, forms a team, and executes
5. Updates the consensus file
6. Sleeps, then repeats

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto-loop.sh -- the simplest possible orchestrator

while true; do
    CONSENSUS=$(cat memories/consensus.md)

    claude -p "You are an autonomous AI company.
Read the consensus, decide the next action,
form a team, and execute.

$CONSENSUS" \
        --model opus \
        --dangerously-skip-permissions

    sleep 120  # 2-minute cooldown between cycles
done
```

In production, you add hardening: a watchdog timer (kill runaway cycles after 30 minutes), a circuit breaker (3 consecutive errors = cooldown), rate limit detection, and atomic writes to prevent corrupted state.

But start simple. Get the loop running, then add safeguards as you discover failure modes.

---

## Step 4: Add convergence rules

Without rules, agents will discuss forever. They love to brainstorm, research, and plan. Left unchecked, you get beautiful documents and zero code.

Convergence rules are hard constraints that force progress:

| Rule | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Cycle 1 = brainstorm only | Gives agents one shot to propose ideas |
| Cycle 2 = validate only | Forces GO/NO-GO before building |
| Cycle 3+ = must produce artifacts | Bans pure discussion -- code or deploy, no excuses |
| Same Next Action twice = stalled | Detects loops and forces direction change |
| Ship > Plan > Discuss | If you can ship it, don't discuss it |

These rules sound restrictive but they're the single most important part of the system. Without them, Auto-Co produced three beautiful research documents in three cycles with zero code. With them, it shipped a landing page in one cycle.

---

## Step 5: Control costs

Multi-agent systems can get expensive if you're not careful. Here's what keeps Auto-Co under $2 per cycle:

- **Select 3-5 agents per cycle, not all 14.** Most tasks only need 2-3 specialists. A blog post needs Marketing + Builder. A deployment needs DevOps + QA.
- **30-minute watchdog timer.** Kills runaway cycles before they burn your API budget.
- **Circuit breaker.** 3 consecutive errors triggers a cooldown instead of burning tokens on retries.
- **Boring infrastructure.** Railway at $5/month, Supabase free tier. No Kubernetes.

After 96 cycles, Auto-Co's total cost is ~$181. That's a full product -- landing page, pricing, demo dashboard, blog, analytics, waitlist -- for less than a day of contractor work.

---

## Step 6: Handle failures gracefully

Things will break. Here are the failure modes we've seen and how we handle them:

### Gold-plating

Agents spend an entire cycle perfecting a button color instead of shipping. **Fix:** Convergence rules force artifact production after Cycle 2.

### State corruption

A cycle crashes mid-write and corrupts the consensus file. **Fix:** Atomic writes -- write to a temp file, then rename. The file is either fully updated or untouched.

### Discussion loops

Agents keep saying "let's research more" instead of building. **Fix:** The stall detector -- if the same Next Action appears twice, force a direction change.

### Silent failures

Something breaks but nobody notices (like analytics being silently blocked by ad blockers). **Fix:** Include a verification step in every cycle -- check that what you deployed actually works before updating the consensus.

## The complete architecture

Here's how all the pieces fit together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Try it yourself

Auto-Co is MIT licensed. The fastest way to get started:

```bash
npx create-auto-co init my-company
cd my-company
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
./auto-loop.sh
```

Or clone the repo directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta
cd auto-co-meta
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
./auto-loop.sh
```

You'll need: Claude Code CLI installed, an Anthropic API key (Opus recommended), Node.js, and git.

Within 3 cycles, your agent team will have brainstormed a product idea, validated it, and started building. The entire framework -- agent definitions, convergence rules, consensus template, and the loop -- is in the repo.
