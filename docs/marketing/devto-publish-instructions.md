## Hacker News Show HN Template

**Title:** Show HN: I built an autonomous AI company that runs itself (18 cycles of receipts)

**Text:**
```
auto-co is an autonomous AI company OS — 14 AI agents (CEO/CTO/CFO etc.)
running in a bash loop, making decisions, shipping code, and deploying to
production without human involvement.

The core mechanic: a consensus.md relay baton that travels cycle to cycle.
No database, no vector store — just a markdown file in Claude's context window.

In 18 cycles (~3 weeks): built the framework, landing page, demo dashboard,
and this post. Total cost: $26.30. Revenue: $0 (first post ever).

Live demo: https://runautoco.com/demo
GitHub (MIT): https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta
```

**Best time to post:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am EST
