**Auto-Co** is an open-source framework for running a fully autonomous AI company. You give it a mission. It forms a team of specialized AI agents, loops continuously, and ships real software — to real infrastructure, with real deployments.

This repo is the framework itself — currently being built and maintained by an auto-co instance running autonomously (yes, it wrote most of this).

## What the AI team has shipped (62 cycles in)

This repo is being built by an auto-co instance running itself. Here's what it has autonomously produced:

No humans wrote the code. No humans made the product decisions. The loop runs, the agents argue, and things get shipped.

---

## What it does

Every cycle, auto-co:

1. **Reads the shared consensus** — current state, what was done, what's next
2. **Forms a team** — picks 3–5 agents relevant to the task
3. **Executes** — writes code, deploys services, publishes content, analyzes competitors
4. **Updates the relay baton** — writes the next action for the next cycle

Decisions that require a human (spending money, legal questions, credentials) are escalated via Telegram. Everything else is autonomous.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com), [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code), Node.js 20+, git

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta
cd auto-co-meta

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

# 3. Start
make start

# 4. Monitor in another terminal
make monitor
```

With Docker:

```bash
make docker-start    # loop + dashboard
make docker-monitor  # tail logs
```

```

**The loop is deliberately simple:** `auto-loop.sh` calls Claude Code with `PROMPT.md`, which reads the consensus, picks a team, executes, and writes a new consensus. Repeat.

./monitor.sh --trend        # Cost & duration trend with sparklines (last 20)
./monitor.sh --trend 10     # Trend for last N cycles
```

### Consensus diff logging

After each successful cycle, the loop compares consensus before and after. If it changed, a unified diff is saved to `logs/consensus-diff-NNNN.diff` and a log line records the change.

---

## Human Escalation

When agents hit a true blocker (spending money, legal, credentials):

1. CEO writes to `memories/human-request.md`
2. `watcher.js` detects it and sends you a Telegram message
3. You reply in Telegram
4. Watcher writes the reply to `memories/human-response.md`
5. Next cycle incorporates the answer

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env`. Without them, escalation requests are written to the file but not messaged out.

---

## Safety Guardrails

**Hard limits (never violated):**

- No repo/project deletion
- No database resets
- No force push to main
- No credential leaks to public repos
- No spending without human approval

**Allowed:** create repos, deploy services, install packages, write files, push branches, open PRs — all autonomously.

## Why auto-co vs. LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI?

| | auto-co | LangGraph / AutoGen |
|--|---------|---------------------|
| Philosophy | Opinionated company OS | General-purpose framework |
| Setup | Clone → .env → make start | Build your own workflows |
| Persistence | Git + markdown | Varies (often in-memory) |
| Human-in-loop | Telegram, async | Usually synchronous |
| Output | Real deployments, real repos | Demos and prototypes |
| Scope | Full company operation | Task execution |

**The key difference:** auto-co is not a library. It's a running company with a mission.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Anthropic API key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No | For human escalation notifications |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | No | Your Telegram chat ID |
| `LOOP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | No | Pause between cycles (default: 300) |

### Plugins (lifecycle hooks)

Run custom scripts before/after each cycle with `--plugin DIR`:

```bash
mkdir plugins
cat > plugins/post-cycle.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Cycle $AUTO_CO_CYCLE finished with status $AUTO_CO_STATUS (cost: $AUTO_CO_COST)"
EOF
chmod +x plugins/post-cycle.sh

./auto-loop.sh --plugin ./plugins
```

Hook scripts receive context via `AUTO_CO_*` environment variables. Hooks time out after 10 seconds to prevent stalling the loop.

### Parallel Sessions

Run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously alongside each cycle with `--parallel DIR`:

```bash
mkdir parallel-prompts
echo 'Review and update project documentation.' > parallel-prompts/docs.md
echo 'Run all tests and fix any failures.' > parallel-prompts/tests.md

./auto-loop.sh --parallel ./parallel-prompts
```

Each `.md` file in the directory becomes an independent Claude session that runs concurrently with the main cycle. Parallel sessions:
- Get their own log files (`cycle-NNNN-parallel-<name>.log`)
- Share the same timeout as the main cycle
- Have their costs tracked and added to the total
- Don't affect the main cycle's success/failure if they fail

Also configurable via environment: `PARALLEL_DIR=./parallel-prompts ./auto-loop.sh`

### Project Templates

Scaffold new projects from pre-built templates with `--template`:

```bash
# List available templates
./auto-loop.sh --template

# Scaffold from a template
./auto-loop.sh --template saas ~/Projects/my-saas
./auto-loop.sh --template docs-site ~/Projects/my-docs
./auto-loop.sh --template api-backend ~/Projects/my-api
```

Each template pre-configures the mission, tech stack, directory structure, and initial consensus so the AI team starts with context instead of a blank slate. Available templates:

| Template | Description | Tech Stack |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `saas` | Full-stack SaaS with auth, billing, landing page | Next.js + Supabase + Stripe + Railway |
| `docs-site` | Developer docs with search, versioning, SEO | Next.js + MDX + Vercel |
| `api-backend` | Production API with auth, rate limiting, monitoring | Node.js + Express/Fastify + Railway + Supabase |

Create custom templates by adding a directory under `templates/` with `template.conf`, `mission.md`, and `consensus-next-action.md`.

## Hosted Version

Self-hosting requires a server and technical setup. A managed, no-code hosted version is in development:

- **Hosted ($49/mo):** Zero setup, dashboard included, Telegram built in, auto-updates
- **Pro ($99/mo):** Multiple projects, custom agents, webhook integrations
