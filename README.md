## What is this?

You give auto-co a one-line mission. It assembles a team of 14 AI agents — CEO, CTO, Designer, Engineer, QA, Marketing, CFO — and they debate, decide, build, and deploy in a continuous loop. 24/7. No human in the loop.

It's not a chatbot. It's not a copilot. It's **a company that runs itself.**

## Real companies, running right now

We're currently running **4 auto-co instances in parallel**. Each one picked its own product, built it from scratch, deployed it, and is now doing marketing and user acquisition — all autonomously.

### FormReply — *112 cycles, $0 human code*
> "Auto-reply to every contact form submission with AI."

An auto-co instance researched the market, picked the idea, built a full-stack SaaS with OAuth (Google Forms, Typeform, Jotform, Tally, Webhooks), Stripe billing, email notifications, and deployed it to production. Live at [formreply.app](https://formreply.app).

### Changelog.dev — *68 cycles, $0 human code*
> "Beautiful changelogs for developer tools."

Another auto-co instance built a changelog platform with GitHub integration, email notifications, a widget you can embed, and Stripe payments. Live at [changelogdev.com](https://www.changelogdev.com).

### auto-co itself — *89+ cycles, $0 human code*
> "Make auto-co production-ready and sellable."

This repo. The framework is building and improving itself. The landing page, demo dashboard, blog, pricing page, CLI tools — all shipped autonomously.

**Average cost per cycle: ~$1.80. Total infrastructure: ~$5/mo on Railway.**

## Get started in 2 minutes

**All you need is a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) subscription.** No separate API key required — auto-co works with the same Claude Code CLI you already have.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta
cd auto-co-meta
make start
```

That's it. In another terminal: `make monitor` to watch it work.

Want to start from a template?

```bash
./auto-loop.sh --template saas ~/Projects/my-startup
```

Templates: `saas` (Next.js + Supabase + Stripe), `docs-site` (MDX + Vercel), `api-backend` (Express + Railway).

## The 14 agents

| | Agent | Modeled after | What they do |
|--|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Strategy | CEO | Jeff Bezos | Priorities, decisions, direction |
| | CTO | Werner Vogels | Architecture, tech choices |
| | Critic | Charlie Munger | Veto bad ideas, pre-mortem |
| Product | Product | Don Norman | UX, features, usability |
| | Design | Matias Duarte | Visual design, design system |
| | Interaction | Alan Cooper | User flows, personas |
| Engineering | Fullstack | DHH | Write code, ship features |
| | QA | James Bach | Test strategy, quality gates |
| | DevOps | Kelsey Hightower | Deploy, CI/CD, infra |
| Business | Marketing | Seth Godin | Positioning, distribution |
| | Operations | Paul Graham | User acquisition, retention |
| | Sales | Aaron Ross | Pricing, conversion |
| | CFO | Patrick Campbell | Financial model, unit economics |
| Intelligence | Research | Ben Thompson | Market research, competitive analysis |

Each cycle picks 3-5 agents relevant to the task. They don't all run every time.

---

## How the loop works

```
read consensus → pick agents → execute → write next action → sleep → repeat
```

State lives in markdown files — `consensus.md` is the relay baton between cycles. Everything survives restarts. The loop runs with a single shell script (`auto-loop.sh`) calling Claude Code with a prompt.

When agents hit a real blocker (spending money, credentials, legal), they escalate to you via Telegram. You reply, next cycle picks it up. This happens maybe once every 20-30 cycles.

---

## Why not LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI?

| | auto-co | Agent frameworks |
|--|---------|-----------------|
| Setup | `git clone` → `make start` | Build your own workflows |
| Output | Real deployed products | Demos and prototypes |
| State | Git + markdown (survives anything) | Often in-memory |
| Scope | Runs a full company | Executes tasks |

**auto-co is not a library.** It's an opinionated system that ships real software to real users.

---

## Safety

Hard limits that can never be overridden:
- No repo/project deletion
- No database resets
- No force push to main
- No credential leaks
- No spending without human approval

Everything else — creating repos, deploying services, writing code, pushing branches — is fair game.
