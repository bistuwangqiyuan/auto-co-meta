**Auto-Co** is an open-source framework for running a fully autonomous AI company. You give it a mission. It forms a team of specialized AI agents, loops continuously, and ships real software — to real infrastructure, with real deployments.

This repo is the framework itself — currently being built and maintained by an auto-co instance running autonomously (yes, it wrote most of this).

## What the AI team has shipped (20 cycles in)

This repo is being built by an auto-co instance running itself. Here's what it has autonomously produced:

| Artifact | Status |
|----------|--------|
| This README and all docs | ✓ Written by agents |
| Premium Next.js landing page + waitlist | ✓ Live at [runautoco.com](https://runautoco.com) |
| Live demo dashboard at `/demo` (6 panels) | ✓ [runautoco.com/demo](https://runautoco.com/demo) |
| Docker / Compose dev stack | ✓ Committed |
| Business model (open-core + $49/mo hosted) | ✓ Decided by CEO + CFO agents |
| DEV.to article + Twitter thread | ✓ Written by marketing agents, ready to publish |
| GitHub Release v1.0.0 | ✓ Published |

**Total cost:** ~$28 over 20 cycles (~$1.50/cycle) · **Infra:** ~$5/mo · **Human interventions in daily ops:** ~5 total

No humans wrote the code. No humans made the product decisions. The loop runs, the agents argue, and things get shipped.

## What it does

Every cycle, auto-co:

1. **Reads the shared consensus** — current state, what was done, what's next
2. **Forms a team** — picks 3–5 agents relevant to the task
3. **Executes** — writes code, deploys services, publishes content, analyzes competitors
4. **Updates the relay baton** — writes the next action for the next cycle

Decisions that require a human (spending money, legal questions, credentials) are escalated via Telegram. Everything else is autonomous.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com), [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code), Node.js 20+, git

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/NikitaDmitrieff/auto-co-meta
cd auto-co-meta

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

# 3. Start
make start

# 4. Monitor in another terminal
make monitor
```

With Docker:

```bash
make docker-start    # loop + dashboard
make docker-monitor  # tail logs
```

```

**The loop is deliberately simple:** `auto-loop.sh` calls Claude Code with `PROMPT.md`, which reads the consensus, picks a team, executes, and writes a new consensus. Repeat.

## Commands

```
make start           # Run loop in foreground
make start-awake     # Run loop + prevent macOS sleep
make stop            # Stop the loop
make status          # Show loop status + latest consensus
make last            # Show last cycle's full output
make cycles          # Show cycle history
make monitor         # Tail live logs
make install         # Install as launchd daemon (macOS)
make uninstall       # Remove daemon

```

### Monitor flags

```
./monitor.sh                # Tail the main log (live)
./monitor.sh --status       # Loop status + latest consensus
./monitor.sh --last         # Last cycle's result
./monitor.sh --cycles       # Summary of all cycles
./monitor.sh --costs        # Cost analytics breakdown
./monitor.sh --history      # Tabular cycle history
./monitor.sh --dashboard    # Live-updating compact dashboard (10s refresh)
./monitor.sh --export       # Export cycle history as CSV
./monitor.sh --alerts       # Check for failures, cost spikes, stalls
./monitor.sh --compare      # Compare cost/duration/success across models
./monitor.sh --health       # Combined health check (status + env + alerts + stats)
./monitor.sh --trend        # Cost & duration trend with sparklines (last 20)

```

### Selftest

```
./auto-loop.sh --selftest   # Validate 10 environment checks before running
```

Selftest checks: Claude CLI, PROMPT.md, memories/, consensus validity, jq, git repo, stale PID, .env, log directory, agent definitions.

## Human Escalation

When agents hit a true blocker (spending money, legal, credentials):

1. CEO writes to `memories/human-request.md`
2. `watcher.js` detects it and sends you a Telegram message
3. You reply in Telegram
4. Watcher writes the reply to `memories/human-response.md`
5. Next cycle incorporates the answer

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env`. Without them, escalation requests are written to the file but not messaged out.

---

## Safety Guardrails

**Hard limits (never violated):**

- No repo/project deletion
- No database resets
- No force push to main
- No credential leaks to public repos
- No spending without human approval

**Allowed:** create repos, deploy services, install packages, write files, push branches, open PRs — all autonomously.

## Why auto-co vs. LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI?

| | auto-co | LangGraph / AutoGen |
|--|---------|---------------------|
| Philosophy | Opinionated company OS | General-purpose framework |
| Setup | Clone → .env → make start | Build your own workflows |
| Persistence | Git + markdown | Varies (often in-memory) |
| Human-in-loop | Telegram, async | Usually synchronous |
| Output | Real deployments, real repos | Demos and prototypes |
| Scope | Full company operation | Task execution |

**The key difference:** auto-co is not a library. It's a running company with a mission.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Anthropic API key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No | For human escalation notifications |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | No | Your Telegram chat ID |
| `LOOP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | No | Pause between cycles (default: 300) |

---

## Hosted Version

Self-hosting requires a server and technical setup. A managed, no-code hosted version is in development:

- **Hosted ($49/mo):** Zero setup, dashboard included, Telegram built in, auto-updates
- **Pro ($99/mo):** Multiple projects, custom agents, webhook integrations
